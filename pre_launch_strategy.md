## Waitlist Strategy

### Waitlist Landing Page Development

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. Create a simple, mobile-friendly landing page using Carrd or Mailchimp
   - Estimated time: 1-2 days
   - Cost: $0-19/month depending on platform choice

2. Design key landing page elements:
   - Clear headline: "Be the First to Access New Mexico's Local Food Marketplace"
   - Subheadline: "Path to Plate connects local producers with buyers across New Mexico"
   - Brief value proposition highlighting key benefits for both producers and buyers
   - Simple sign-up form collecting:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Organization
     - User type (Producer/Buyer)
     - Product categories (for producers) or purchasing interests (for buyers)
   - Visual elements showcasing the platform interface
   - Partner logos (NM Grown Coalition, NMDA, NMFMA)
   - FAQ section addressing common questions

3. Implement technical elements:
   - Connect form to email marketing platform
   - Set up automated thank you/confirmation emails
   - Install analytics tracking
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness
   - Optimize page load speed

**Reasoning and Purpose:**
A dedicated waitlist landing page creates a central conversion point for all marketing efforts. By collecting segmented information during sign-up, you'll be able to tailor follow-up communications and better understand your initial user base. The simple design focuses on conversion rather than comprehensive information.

**Best Practices and Tips:**
- Keep the form as short as possible while still collecting essential information
- Include social proof elements like partner logos and testimonials (if available)
- Clearly communicate the benefit of joining the waitlist (early access, special onboarding support)
- Implement A/B testing on headline and form placement if possible
- Ensure the page loads quickly and works well on mobile devices

### Waitlist Incentives

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. Develop tiered incentives for waitlist sign-ups:
   - Early access to the platform (1-2 weeks before public launch)
   - Personalized onboarding session
   - Featured profile for first 100 sign-ups
   - Waived fees for first transaction (if applicable)

2. Create segment-specific incentives:
   - **For Producers**: Free professional profile photo session at launch event
   - **For Buyers**: Curated introduction to 5 relevant producers
   - **For Both**: Exclusive invitation to pre-launch webinar with industry experts

3. Implement referral bonuses:
   - Provide unique referral links to waitlist members
   - Offer additional benefits for successful referrals
   - Track and acknowledge top referrers

**Reasoning and Purpose:**
Incentives create urgency and provide tangible benefits for early adoption. Segment-specific incentives address the unique needs and motivations of different user groups, while referral bonuses leverage word-of-mouth marketing to expand reach organically.

**Best Practices and Tips:**
- Ensure incentives are valuable but realistic to deliver
- Clearly communicate incentives on the landing page and in follow-up emails
